## How it works

A first-order continuous-time sigma-delta modulator analog-to-digital
converter on the 3.3 V analog supply: an active-RC integrator (folded
cascode operational transconductance amplifier), a StrongARM comparator
with a retiming flip-flop, and a return-to-zero resistive feedback DAC.
The 50 MHz bitstream is decimated off-chip two ways at once - a fast path
(~1 MHz bandwidth, ≥6 ENOB, protection/trip use) and a precision path
(~100 kHz, 10+ ENOB, measurement use).

The full design story - every architecture decision with its supporting
data, the tiered verification methodology, and continuously-rebuilt
simulation results - lives in the design repository and its generated
design document:

**v0 wiring (evolves as blocks land):** ua[0] and ua[1] are wired to the OTA's input and output (extraction-verified), making v0 a probe-able OTA test structure while the remaining blocks land. Final plan: ua[0] = VIN (0.4-1.4 V), ua[1] = analog monitor, uo[0]/uo[1] = Q/QB bitstream, clk = 50 MHz.

**Status: work in progress toward the shuttle deadline.** The current GDS
contains the verified OTA macro (DRC-clean, LVS-clean, parasitic-
extracted and re-simulated); comparator, retimer, references, bias and
top-level routing land next, from the same generated-and-verified flow.

## How to test

Drive VIN (ua[0]) with a signal in the 0.4-1.4 V range, clock at 50 MHz,
and decimate the Q/QB bitstream (uo[0]/uo[1]) with a sinc or CIC filter
(an FPGA with a differential-capable input is the reference receiver).

## External hardware

Low-jitter 50 MHz clock source; FPGA or logic analyzer to capture the
bitstream.
